Project 2
===========

Team 4:
	Kim Bradley
	Wes Ishee
	Edward Killmeier
	Chris Klappich
	James Smith

This project implements the Join Operator, Simple Indexing and FileList.

To run the code, compile files included in the .zip file. The Main method is
located in MovieDB.java

Commands:
     javac MovieDB.java
     java MovieDB
     
The output is that of the original tables used and a few test cases for select,
project, union, and minus.

Our javadoc files are located in the folder named "doc". Open index.html to be
brought to a website including all the javadocs on one handy site.  

Our union method is not set up to return the original table in the event of a
compatability error. This was not a requirement stated in comments, so it was
not implemented. We were not penalized for this in Project 1.
