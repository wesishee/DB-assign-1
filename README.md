DB-assign-1
===========
This is the project for Team 4 including Wes Ishee, James Smith, Kim Bradley, Edward Killmeier, and Chris Klappich.



Our infix to postfix is not set up to handle parentheses when evaluating operators.  It was not a requirement and so was not implemented.  We have spoken with Dr. Arpinar and this is fine.
