DB-assign-1
===========
This is the project for Team 4 including Wes Ishee, James Smith, Kim Bradley, Edward Killmeier, and Chris Klappich.

To run the code, compile all .java files included in the .zip file.  The main method is in MovieDB.java so to prove the methods this team wrote actually work, run MovieDB.  

The commands are as follows:
javac KeyType.java MovieDB.java String2Type.java Table.java
java MovieDB

Our javadoc files are located in the folder named "doc".  Open index.html to be brought to a website including all the javadocs on one handy site.  

Our infix to postfix is not set up to handle parentheses when evaluating operators.  It was not a requirement and so was not implemented.  We have spoken with Dr. Arpinar and this is fine.
